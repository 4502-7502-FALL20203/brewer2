             <h2>Shelter Gardens</h2>
            <p>Although this is a small garden/park area, it is a great place to sit & visit with someone, read a book, have a picnic, walk, or relax. The trees, lawns, and plants are well-maintained. The trees and most plants have a name label and there are many plants. The koi pool is in a shaded area, so you can easily spend a long time watching the fish. </p>

     <h2>The Blue Note</h2>
          <p>Great venue for live music! The staff is always friendly and very helpful. There is a balcony for larger crowds. They will leave it closed off if they notice there isn't a large crowd which makes seating minimal.</p>
